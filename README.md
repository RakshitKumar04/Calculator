# Maths Calculator
My project is on a calculator that does some basic calculations.
To run the CalculatorGUI file, clone this repo onto your machine, navigate to the folder, and run the CalculatorGui file using `python CalculatorGUI`

## dependencies:
- python3.6+
- tkinter module
```pip install tkinter```

## Known Bugs in GUI:
- might crash on macos Mojave as Apple screwed um TCl configuration in a few versions.(works on macos Catalina tho)
- padding sizes might be different for different OS and different screen size.
