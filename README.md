# Maths Calculator
My project is on a calculator that does some basic calculations.

You'll need the tkinter module for running this.
To run the CalculatorGUI file, clone this repo onto your machine,
navigate to the folder using cd path/to/clone/folder,
and run the CalculatorGUI file using `python CalculatorGUI.py`

## dependencies:
- python3.6+
- tkinter module
```pip install tkinter```

## Known Bugs in GUI:
- might crash on macos Mojave as Apple screwed um TCl configuration in a few versions.(works on macos Catalina tho)
- padding sizes might be different for different OS and different screen size.
